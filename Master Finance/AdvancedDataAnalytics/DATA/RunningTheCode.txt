To Run the code:
1. Run main_ml.py: This will execute all from generation the Data to testing it on the test set.
As we used a hyperparameter tuning method to run our code (which took more than 6hours), we have added a version
where you can run the code with the optimal parameters we found hard coded into the code.
You can find the random searching method as commented out in main_ml.py. Also, to avoid that the model we trained
gets overriden, we have also commented out the saving method.

2. When the Model is trained ( if you decided to train a new model) or using the model we trained, you can run
ML.py, which will use this model to do the simulation of the games and using the model for investment decisions.

3. None of the others files needs to be run, also, all steps from the hyper parameter tunning can be found in the
respective folder. We have also provided a .pdf that shows the output of the code when running the whole random searching process.
