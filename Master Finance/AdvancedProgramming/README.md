# Overview
Abstract:
This document presents a trading game we developed in the context of the advanced programming course at the University of Lausanne. In our game, the player makes investment decisions based on four variables: Fed rate, inflation, bond prices and stock prices. In this interactive scenario, the player tactically allocates their resources between bonds, equities, and cash within their investment portfolio. Each round sees fluctuations in the four graphical representations, demanding the player's constant portfolio adjustments. Victory is achieved by reaching a predetermined portfolio return by the game's conclusion. Our aim is to manifest our enthusiasm for finance and gaming through this engaging project.
