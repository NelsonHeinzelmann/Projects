# This Repository
Hello, I am Nelson Heinzelmann and am currently pursuing an MSc in Finance with a specialization in Financial Entrepreneurship & Data Science at HEC Lausanne. This repository showcases a selection of my notable projects, including an analysis of the impact of Commodity price shocks on the US GDP using VAR and SVAR models, a Staggered DiD model investigating the relationship between Policy rates and Exchange rates, a trading game simulator, and an LSTM model designed for price predictions.

# Expertise and Future Plans
My main expertise lies in Asset and risk management. Additionally, I have gained comprehensive knowledge of various concepts and tools commonly used in data science, including Python (data structures, OOP, TensorFlow, etc.), Stata, C++ (basic understanding of OOP and parallel programming, including MPI and OMP), and LaTeX. This expertise allows me to effectively implement diverse models from the fields of finance, economics, and beyond. 
Although the projects displayed on this page offer only a glimpse into my capabilities, they are a rather good representative sample of the diverse models I have explored. However, it is important to note that there are several subjects related to Asset & Risk management that are not featured in this repository. These include mainly Time-Series analysis, implementation of statistical arbitrage strategies and more related to econometrics.

In the future, I hope to be able to work on more ML models to enhance my understanding of TensorFlow and also have a broader understanding of its applications in Finance. Also, I want to keep working on more complex models to model Volatility as it remains one of my favourite subjects to study
