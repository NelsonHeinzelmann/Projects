# Projects
In this repository, I will showcase the projects I worked on during my time at HEC Lausanne, encompassing both Bachelor's and Master's works, with a focus on the Data Science & Entrepreneurship option within the Master in Finance program. These projects primarily utilize Python and Stata, employing various models such as LSTM, VAR, SVAR, and Staggered DiD.

Some of the prominent projects that I have not shared on my GitHub page involves exploring diverse financial models in Python, with a specific emphasis on volatility modeling. Additionally, throughout my studies, I have delved into advanced topics beyond what is presented here. This includes gaining proficiency in C++ (OOP), parallel programming (both in Python and C++), and possessing an advanced level of expertise in Stata, working extensively with various statistical models. I find all of these subjects particularly fascinating when they are integrated with the field of Finance or Economics.

# Expertise and Future Plans
My primary area of expertise lies in Python, where I have acquired comprehensive knowledge of various concepts and tools. Specifically, I have a strong command of data structures, including Numpy and Pandas, and I am proficient in implementing SQL queries within these libraries. Additionally, I am well-versed in object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and have utilized TensorFlow for machine learning tasks.

While my current focus has primarily been on LSTM models in machine learning, I possess a broader theoretical understanding of the field of AI as a whole. I am deeply passionate about AI and strive to expand my knowledge and expertise in this domain continually. I am eager to explore more complex machine learning models and deepen my practical experience in the field.

In terms of my future plans, I aim to further enhance my proficiency in TensorFlow by actively seeking out projects that involve its application. Additionally, I am interested in exploring Pybind to improve my understanding of its usage and integration with Python.
Please feel free to explore the projects I have undertaken, and if you have any questions or require further information, I am here to assist you!
