# Projects
In this repository, I will showcase the projects I worked on during my time at HEC Lausanne, encompassing both Bachelor's and Master's works, with a focus on the Data Science & Entrepreneurship option within the Master in Finance program. These projects primarily utilize Python and Stata, employing various models such as LSTM, VAR, SVAR, and Staggered DiD.

One of the prominent projects that I have shared on my GitHub page involves exploring diverse financial models in Python, with a specific emphasis on volatility modeling. Additionally, throughout my studies, I have delved into advanced topics beyond what is presented here. This includes gaining proficiency in C++ (OOP), parallel programming (both in Python and C++), and possessing an advanced level of expertise in Stata, working extensively with various statistical models.

In general, my strongest expertise lies in Python, where I possess comprehensive knowledge of data structures such as Numpy and Pandas (including implementing SQL), object-oriented programming (OOP), and utilizing TensorFlow. However, I am continuously striving to enhance my skills in the field of machine learning, as I am yet to work with more complex models beyond LSTM.

Feel free to explore the projects I have undertaken, and if you require further information or assistance, please let me know!
