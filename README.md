# Projects
These are the projects I had the chance to work on during my time at HEC Lausanne.
They consist of both Bachelors works, as well as Master in Finance option Data Science & Entrepreneurship.
The subjects I have worked on are mainly based in Python, but also Stata. I have had the chance to use various models such as LSTM, VAR & SVAR, Staggered DiD (Where my colleagues and I wrote all from scratch).
