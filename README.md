Bachelor HEC Lausanne Coursework : Impact of Commodity Price Shocks on US GDP

Overview:
This research paper examines the influence of commodity price shocks on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States. The study utilizes data from the FRED database of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis spanning a period of 19 years. To analyze the relationship, both a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model and a Structural VAR (SVAR) model are employed. The paper aims to estimate the Impulse Response Functions of these models and investigates the effects of a one-standard-deviation shock to the growth rate of commodity prices on the growth rate of GDP. The findings indicate a positive impact on GDP growth rate in response to commodity price shocks in both models.
