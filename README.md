# Projects Repository
Welcome to my projects repository! This repository showcases the projects I have worked on during my time at HEC Lausanne, encompassing both my Bachelor's and Master's works. Within the Master in Finance program, I specialized in the Data Science & Entrepreneurship option, focusing on leveraging Python and Stata to explore various models such as LSTM, VAR, SVAR, and Staggered DiD.

# Contents
The repository contains a selection of prominent projects that I have worked on during my academic journey. In addition to the projects shared on my GitHub page, I have also delved into advanced topics beyond what is presented here. These include exploring diverse financial models in Python, with a specific emphasis on volatility modeling. Moreover, throughout my studies, I have acquired proficiency in various areas, such as:

C++ (OOP): I have developed a solid understanding of object-oriented programming principles in C++.
Parallel Programming: I have gained experience in parallel programming using both Python and C++.
Advanced Stata: I possess an advanced level of expertise in Stata and have extensively worked with various statistical models.
LaTeX: I am proficient in LaTeX and can effectively utilize it to write reports and documents.
I find integrating these subjects with the fields of Finance and Economics particularly fascinating.

# Expertise and Future Plans
My primary area of expertise lies in Python. I have acquired comprehensive knowledge of various concepts and tools that are widely used in data science. Specifically, I have a strong command of data structures, including libraries like Numpy and Pandas. Furthermore, I am proficient in implementing SQL queries within these libraries, enabling efficient data manipulation and analysis. Additionally, I am well-versed in object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and have utilized TensorFlow for machine learning tasks. While my focus has primarily been on LSTM models in machine learning, I possess a broader theoretical understanding of the field of AI as a whole.

Although I have not yet had the opportunity to work extensively on projects based on the scikit-learn (sklearn) library, I am familiar with its functionalities and confident in my ability to leverage it for various machine learning tasks.

Looking ahead, I am committed to expanding my proficiency in TensorFlow by actively seeking out projects that involve its application. Additionally, I am interested in exploring Pybind to further enhance my understanding of its usage and integration with Python.
